(Coin Tossing)

Write an application that simulates coin tossing.  Let the application toss a coin each time the user chooses the “Toss Coin” menu option.  Count the number of times each side of the coin appears.  Display the results.  The application should call a separate method Flip that takes no arguments and returns false for tails and true for heads.  [Note:  If the application realistically simulates coin tossing, each side of the coin should appear approximately half the time.]
